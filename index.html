           <p>We are living in an unprecedented time, characterized by the rapid
             progress of AI technology that holds the capacity to revolutionize 
             our lives and occupations like never before, particularly when it comes
              to the world of art. </p>
              <p>We at Fiverr are eager to embrace the opportunities unfolding before
                 us and to explore what happens when top tech meets top talent. That's
                  why we're calling all artists to use the latest generative tools in a 
                  unique competition that simulates real-life business needs.</p>
                  <b>How It Works</b>
                  <p>Starting today, all artists will be able to take their shot at the prizes
                     by creating stunning AI-generated artwork. To enter, participants must choose between
                      3 briefs from hypothetical businesses in need of AI-generated artwork, fill out all
                       required fields in the submission form, and submit their work in accordance with
                        the submission guidelines posted on https://contests.fiverr.com/ai-art-2023.
                         Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 pm EST on August 27th,
                          2023 to be considered.</p>
                          <p>An all-star judges panel, including Nadav Barkan, Evyatar Edri, and Tal Zagreba,
                             will determine the winners, based on submissions that demonstrate
                              understanding of their chosen briefs, as well as creativity, originality,
                               aesthetic appeal, and a mastery of AI. One winner and runner-up
                                will be crowned for each of the 3 briefs.</p>
                                <b>The Prizes</b>
